# Creating Commits

## Changes
When you are creating a Commit,
make sure there are actual Changes
to the github file(s)

## Branches
When creating a Commit,
make sure to send it to another branch,
mainly for developers...
this prevents accidental file leaks such
as Changelogs being leaked.

## Merging
When Conditions are met,
your Branch/Pull Request will be
Merged with either the ```base``` Branch or
```indev``` Branch. Depending on content.

### Merging Conditions
1. There are actual Changes.
2. It is a Serious Fix/Addition.. etc.
3. There are no Merging issues (this one is github stuff)
4. It's an accepted change by the developers.
